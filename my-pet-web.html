    <h1>The pet web</h1>  
    <p>A pet or companion animal is an animal kept primarily for a person's company, entertainment, or as an act of compassion such as taking in and protecting a hungry stray cat, rather than as a working animal, livestock, or laboratory animal.</p>
    <p>Popular pets are often noted for their attractive appearances, intelligence, and relatable personalities, or may just be accepted as they are because they need a home.</p>
    <h4>Pet are so many but some of them are;</h4>
    <ul>
